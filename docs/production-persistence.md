# CoreHub Production Persistence

CoreHub write-side state now uses an explicit persistence boundary.

## Adapter Contract

The API storage layer owns write-side behavior, while a state store owns durable persistence.

Current state store:

| Store | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `CoreHubLocalJsonStateStore` | Local JSON persistence for development, smoke tests, and single-node bootstrap deployments. |
| `CoreHubSnapshotStateStore` | Generic production-style full-snapshot adapter for mocked DB, KV, or future managed stores. |
| `CoreHubD1StateStore` | Cloudflare D1-style snapshot adapter skeleton for future Worker deployments. |

The state store contract is intentionally small:

| Method | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `load()` | Return a `corehub.local-state.v1` snapshot or `null` when no state exists. |
| `save(snapshot)` | Persist the full write-side snapshot and return it. |

## Production Direction

Production DB, D1, or Postgres adapters should implement the same `load()` and `save(snapshot)` boundary first. Later phases can replace full-snapshot persistence with table-level writes without changing the API or CLI flow.

Required behavior for any production store:

1. Preserve `schemaVersion`.
2. Preserve audit event ordering and hash-chain fields.
3. Persist upload slots, submissions, reviews, package versions, audit events, and audit checkpoints.
4. Fail closed on unsupported schema versions.
5. Provide backup/export before destructive migrations.

## D1 Skeleton

`CoreHubD1StateStore` stores the current full snapshot under a single key while the API contract is still stabilizing. This is deliberately conservative: it gives production-like persistence without changing upload, submit, approve, audit, or projection behavior.

Migration skeleton:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS corehub_state (
  key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  value TEXT NOT NULL,
  updated_at TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

Future phases can split this snapshot into normalized tables for artifact uploads, submissions, reviews, package versions, audit events, and audit checkpoints.

## Local Bootstrap

The server still defaults to local JSON:

```sh
COREHUB_STATE_PATH=.corehub-local/write-side-state.json npm run serve
```

This keeps local development and CI deterministic while the production persistence adapter is introduced.
