# CoreHub Production Persistence

CoreHub write-side state now uses an explicit persistence boundary.

## Adapter Contract

The API storage layer owns write-side behavior, while a state store owns durable persistence.

Current state store:

| Store | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `CoreHubLocalJsonStateStore` | Local JSON persistence for development, smoke tests, and single-node bootstrap deployments. |
| `CoreHubSnapshotStateStore` | Generic production-style full-snapshot adapter for mocked DB, KV, or future managed stores. |
| `CoreHubD1StateStore` | Cloudflare D1-style snapshot adapter skeleton for future Worker deployments. |

The state store contract is intentionally small:

| Method | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `load()` | Return a `corehub.local-state.v1` snapshot or `null` when no state exists. |
| `save(snapshot)` | Persist the full write-side snapshot and return it. |

## Production Direction

Production DB, D1, or Postgres adapters should implement the same `load()` and `save(snapshot)` boundary first. Later phases can replace full-snapshot persistence with table-level writes without changing the API or CLI flow.

Required behavior for any production store:

1. Preserve `schemaVersion`.
2. Preserve audit event ordering and hash-chain fields.
3. Persist upload slots, submissions, reviews, package versions, audit events, and audit checkpoints.
4. Fail closed on unsupported schema versions.
5. Provide backup/export before destructive migrations.

## Backup And Restore Contract

Use the snapshot tool before migrations, destructive schema changes, or state-store adapter swaps:

```sh
npm run persistence:snapshot -- export --input .corehub-local/write-side-state.json --output .corehub-backups/write-side-state.backup.json
npm run persistence:snapshot -- validate --input .corehub-backups/write-side-state.backup.json
npm run persistence:snapshot -- restore --input .corehub-backups/write-side-state.backup.json --output .corehub-local/write-side-state.json --dry-run
```

Restore is dry-run by default unless `--apply` is provided:

```sh
npm run persistence:snapshot -- restore --input .corehub-backups/write-side-state.backup.json --output .corehub-local/write-side-state.json --apply
```

The tool validates:

| Check | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `schemaVersion` | Blocks unsupported snapshot versions. |
| Collection shape | Ensures slots, submissions, reviews, package versions, audit events, and audit checkpoints are arrays. |
| Audit chain shape | Ensures audit sequence and `previousHash` continuity can be inspected before restore. |
| Export hash | Reports a SHA-256 for backup custody records. |

## D1 Skeleton

`CoreHubD1StateStore` stores the current full snapshot under a single key while the API contract is still stabilizing. This is deliberately conservative: it gives production-like persistence without changing upload, submit, approve, audit, or projection behavior.

Migration skeleton:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS corehub_state (
  key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  value TEXT NOT NULL,
  updated_at TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

Future phases can split this snapshot into normalized tables for artifact uploads, submissions, reviews, package versions, audit events, and audit checkpoints.

## Local Bootstrap

The server still defaults to local JSON:

```sh
COREHUB_STATE_PATH=.corehub-local/write-side-state.json npm run serve
```

This keeps local development and CI deterministic while the production persistence adapter is introduced.
